recipes.json {
	no need for:
	{
	recipe ingredients
	recipe instructions
	recipe description
	}

	need {
	recipe id
	name
	meal type

	}
}

third party: pandas

desktop-meal is present in day_calenddar, but changing it breaks meals
mobile and day views (not calendar) need to redefine data attr's to be more useful
