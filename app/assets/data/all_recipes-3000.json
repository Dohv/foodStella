Fill the pot with enough cold water to cover the potatoes by at least 2 inches and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, partially cover the pot, and simmer the potatoes until they are completely tender and easily pierced with a skewer, 30 to 35 minutes.\n1: Drain the potatoes, let them cool just enough that you can handle them, and then peel them. Cut them in half crosswise and pass them through a ricer into a large bowl. Let cool until almost at room temperature, at least 20 minutes.\n2: Lightly flour a work surface. In a small bowl, mix the flour with the salt. Add the egg to the potatoes and then add the flour mixture. Mix with your hands until the flour is moistened and the dough starts to clump together; the dough will still be a bit crumbly at this point. Gather the dough together and press it against the bottom of the bowl until you have a uniform mass. Transfer it to the floured surface and wash your hands.\n3: Knead gently until the flour is fully incorporated and the dough is soft, smooth, and a little sticky, 30 seconds to 1 minute. (Don't overmix it, or the gnocchi will be tough; the dough should feel very delicate.) Move the dough to one side, making sure the surface underneath it is well floured. Cover it with a clean kitchen towel.\n4: Cover two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment and sprinkle lightly with flour.\n5: Remove any lingering bits of dough from your work surface and lightly reflour the surface. Tear off a piece of dough about the size of a large lemon and put the towel back on the rest of the dough so it doesn't dry out.\n6: With the palms of both hands, roll the dough piece on the floured surface into a rope about 3/4 inch in diameter.\n7: With a sharp knife or a bench knife, cut the rope crosswise every 3/4 inch to make roughly 3/4-inch-square gnocchi. Arrange the gnocchi in a single layer on the parchment-covered baking sheets, making sure they don't touch. Repeat until you run out of dough, reflouring the work surface as needed. When all the gnocchi have been cut and spread out on the baking sheets, sprinkle them with a little more flour.\n8: If you're going to use the gnocchi within 2 to 3 hours, they can sit out on the counter. For longer storage, see the make ahead tips below.\n9: You can serve freshly made gnocchi right away or within a couple of hours, or you can freeze them for later use. Put the gnocchi in the freezer while they're still on the baking sheets and freeze until they are hard to the touch, at least one hour. Transfer them to a large zip-top bag or several smaller bags and freeze for up to two months. Cook frozen gnocchi in boiling water in two batches. Frozen gnocchi cause the temperature of the cooking water to drop, so they'll fall apart before the water returns to a boil if there are too many in the pot. Don't refrigerate fresh gnocchi for more than two or three hours, as they tend to ooze water and become soggy.\n10: To save time, skip the fork: Classic Italian homemade gnocchi are pressed on a fork to curl them and impart the traditional ridges. To save time, I just cut them in small squares and leave them as cute little pillows. I think they look prettier, and they're a lot less fussy to make.\n", "recipe_description": "Gnocchi's plump, pillowy texture and mild, delicate flavor make them perfect for rich, hearty sauces like Pan-Seard Gnocchi with Browned Butter & Sage, Gnocchi with Creamy Gorgonzola Sauce, and Gnocchi with Sausage & Leek Ragu. In general, meat sauces are a fantastic match, but butter and cream-based sauces work well, too.   In Italy, gnocchi are usually served after appetizers (antipasti) as a first course (or primo piatto), instead of pasta. And they're followed by a meat and vegetable course (secondo piatto and contorno). When Italians eat gnocchi this way, the portions tend to be on the small side. However, gnocchi can just as easily be served as a main course, preceded or followed by a light green salad. The servings here are for gnocchi served as a main course."},

Place the custard cups on a 15x10x1-inch baking pan; set aside. In a medium mixing bowl use a wire whisk or a rotary beater to beat the 2 eggs, milk, and oil until combined. Add flour and 1\/4 teaspoon salt; beat until smooth. Fill the prepared cups half full with batter. Bake in a 400 degree F oven about 40 minutes or until popovers are very firm and golden brown. Meanwhile, for the poached eggs, lightly grease a large skillet. Add water to skillet until half full. Bring water to boiling. Reduce heat to simmering (bubbles should begin to break the surface of the water). Break one of the 6 eggs into a measuring cup. Carefully slide the egg into simmering water, holding the lip of the cup as close to the water as possible. Repeat with the remaining 5 eggs, allowing each egg to have an equal amount of space in the pan's water. Simmer the eggs, uncovered, for 3 to 5 minutes or until the whites are completely set and the yolks begin to thicken but are not hard. Carefully remove the poached eggs with a slotted spoon, and place the eggs in a large shallow pan of hot water to keep them warm while preparing the sauce. For Lime Hollandaise Sauce, in the top of a double boiler combine egg yolks, 1 tablespoon water, lime juice, and 1\/8 teaspoon salt. Add a piece of the cut up butter. Place over boiling water (upper pan should not touch water). Cook, stirring rapidly with a whisk, until butter melts and sauce begins to thicken. Add the remaining butter, a piece at a time, stirring constantly until melted. Continue to cook and stir about 2 minutes more or until sauce thickens. Immediately remove from heat. If sauce is too thick or curdles, immediately whisk in 1 to 2 tablespoons hot water. Immediately after removing popovers from oven, prick each popover with a fork to let steam escape. Turn off the oven. For crisper popovers, return the popovers to the still-warm oven for 5 to 10 minutes or until desired crispness is reached. Remove popovers from cups. For each serving, split a popover in half and place on a plate. Top each popover with 1 slice of prosciutto. Top prosciutto with a poached egg; spoon about 2 tablespoons of the Lime Hollandaise Sauce over egg. Garnish with lime peel and serve with lime wedges, if desired. Makes 6 main-dish servings.

{"meal_type":"Breakfast","prep_time":"20 mins\\n ","recipe_description":"Picture a lazy weekend morning spent in your cozy kitchen relaxing with a soothing cappuccino. All this perfect setting needs is one of these hot and flaky biscuits topped with melting butter and sweet jelly.","recipe_id":1773,"recipe_ingredients":"Ingredients 2  1  2 teaspoons sugar 1\/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1\/4 teaspoon salt 1\/2 cup shortening or butter 2\/3 cup milk ","recipe_instructions":"In a medium mixing bowl stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, cream of tartar, and salt. Mix well to distribute the baking powder and the salt. Using a pastry blender or fork, cut shortening into flour mixture until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. If you use butter, be sure it is chilled. (Mixing by hand softens the shortening, making the dough sticky and hard to handle.) Gently push the flour-shortening mixture against the sides of the bowl, making a well in the center. Pour the milk into the well all at once. Using a fork, stir just until the mixture follows the fork around the bowl and forms a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead gently 10 to 12 strokes. On the lightly floured surface, pat the dough to 1\/2-inch thickness (or roll it out with a lightly floured rolling pin, if desired). Sprinkle a little flour over dough. Cut biscuit dough with a 2-1\/2-inch round biscuit cutter, pressing the cutter straight down. Be careful not to twist the cutter or flatten the cut biscuit edges or you won't get straight-sided, evenly shaped biscuits. Dip the cutter into flour between cuts to prevent sticking. If you do not have a biscuit cutter, use a straight-sided glass. Or, pat the dough into a 1\/2-inch-thick rectangle and cut into squares or triangles using a sharp knife. Using a metal spatula, carefully transfer the cut biscuits to an ungreased baking sheet. For crusty-sided biscuits, place about 1 inch apart. For soft-sided biscuits, place biscuits close together in an ungreased baking pan. Reroll scraps of dough and cut into biscuit shapes. Try to cut out as many biscuits as possible from a single rolling of dough. Too many rerollings of the dough causes biscuits to be tough and dry. Bake biscuits in 450 degree F oven 10 to 12 minutes or until biscuits are golden on the top and the bottom. Serve warm. Makes 10 biscuits.
