	<hr>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">
		Foodstella is born from the concept of planned spontaneity. Are you the type that likes to go the supermarket and buy anything you find interesting? Mmm… maybe these sundried tomatoes may go well with asparagus soup. Probably not. By the time you go home you’ll have a brief idea of what you might eat the rest of the week by the look of the number of grocery bags. We hope that chicken breast doesn’t spoil by the time you decide to eat it. Or you might put it in the freezer and pop it in the microwave later on… Maybe you are the type that plans every meal by writing down all possible ingredients you might use during the week. Or you constantly skim through recipe books or search online for your next innovation. Is there anything quicker? Simpler? Faster…?
